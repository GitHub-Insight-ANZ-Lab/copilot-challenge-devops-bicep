# Azure DevOps Pipeline Challenge

## Challenge 1: Set up Azure DevOps Pipeline

The goal of this exercise is to create an Azure DevOps Pipeline workflow to deploy the resources created in the previous challenge using the `main.bicep` file.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Deploy Azure Resources using Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Set up Azure DevOps Pipeline:**

   - Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps from Visual Studio Code.
   - Use GitHub Copilot to assist in creating the pipeline file.
   - Configure the pipeline to use the repository containing your `main.bicep` file.

2. **Define Pipeline Stages:**

   - **Build Stage:**
     - Validate the `main.bicep` file using the `az bicep lint --file main.bicep` command.
   - **Deploy Stage:**
     - Deploy the resources defined in the `main.bicep` file using the `az deployment group create` command.

3. **Configure Service Connection:**

   - Ensure you have a service connection set up in Azure DevOps to authenticate and deploy resources to your Azure subscription.

4. **Add Pipeline Variables:**

   - Define necessary pipeline variables for parameters such as resource group name, location, and any other environment-specific values.

5. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - Trigger the pipeline and ensure it runs successfully, deploying the resources to Azure.

### Success Criteria

- The Azure DevOps Pipeline workflow should run successfully.
- The workflow should be structured and run without errors.
- Use GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process.
